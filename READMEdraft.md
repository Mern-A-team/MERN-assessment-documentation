# MacArthur Museum Photo Management Application

### Rory Bell, Amber Emeny, Sarah Aldrich

## Purpose
The MacArthur Museum of Brisbane is a small museum with a large amount of historic image resources. Frequently, these assets are stored in file cabinets and can be hard to find. Currently, there is no tracking system and only a legacy understanding of gaps in the collection or the presence of duplicates. To enable research and the development of new exhibition/publication material the MacArthur museum has been on the hunt for an easy to use image management system. One challenge that always arose was cost. This MERN application aims to solve these problems and present the museum with a tool to upload, label, categorise and search their images at a negligible cost.

## Functionality
- store photos w/ relevant information
- update metadata
- search metadata 
- Download high quality images

We need a two-fold search/sort system. One piece will be user entered data  pertaining to the historical context of an image. However, humans are error prone, and we need a way to add filters to the photos that cannot be misspelled.

## Target Audience
This application is largely designed for internal use by museum staff and volunteers. Using this tool they will be able to sort and manage their images and associated metadata. Currently, the MacArthur Museum digital image assets are stored on a hard drive and only people familiar with the past project can access them. They have been looking for a tool that is able to easily access their collection(s), add to the collection, edit the information present, sort the images, and search for specific topics. We aim to solve this challenge. 

Within the museum there are a variety of roles which will want different permissions and subsequently be targeted differently. 

The Executive Director and the Collection Manager want admin permissions. This will enable them to have access all CRUD operations. They want to be able to update and change category labels, add filters when needed, and delete errors when needed. They will need a simple interface that is easy to learn, use, and understand. 

One level below the admin will be the volunteers who help populate the database. Per the desires of the museum staff, volunteers will be able to upload images, add captions and apply categories. They will not have the ability to delete images or existing comments. Volunteers are a broad demographic ranging from those in high school or university to retirees that want to stay engaged. Again, we want the user experience to be self explanatory.

Lastly, the MacArthur museum wants the option to allow an outside researcher to log in and view their photos. The researcher will not have the ability manipulate the content, but simple be able to view, search, and filter the images. Their purpose is to learn more about a topic and access the related images. Provided that a research will likely only spend a few hours with the application, they need to quickly learn to use it and understand it's options.
